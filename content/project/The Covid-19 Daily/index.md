## Description
In this article, we will have a look at a project of mine called "The Covid-19 Daily". This is a web application written in python with the Flask framework. The purpose of the app is to inform people about the dire situation that our country and the world is facing at the moment.  
  
The web application makes all the data provided by the government easy to understand. It does this by plotting graphs and heat maps of the country.  
  
Apart from just graphs that show relative data, there is also a table that shows the absolute numbers.  
  
You can find the code for this website hosted here:
