I am a high school student who has experimented with IoT, cloud technology and robotics. I am also a member of the "Fedora Join SIG" and contribute occasionally to Fedora Open Source, writitng python scripts and documentation. Passionate about astronomy, autonomy and everything in between, I wish to combine these interests to build autonomous fleet systems that help setup life support on Mars and beyond.
